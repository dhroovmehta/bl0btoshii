## 1. Create Your Account

### 1A. Download Instagram

1. Open the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android)
2. Search for **"Instagram"**
3. Download and install the app
4. Open the app

### 1B. Create Your Account

1. Tap **"Create new account"**
2. Enter your email: **system.zero.level@gmail.com** (same as TikTok/YouTube)
3. Create a password (use a strong, unique password)
4. Choose your username: **bl0btoshii** (same as TikTok)
   - If `bl0btoshii` is taken, try: `bl0btoshii_` or `bl0btoshii.art` or `thebl0btoshii`
   - Keep it as close to your TikTok/YouTube name as possible for brand consistency
5. Enter your name: **bl0btoshii** (you'll change the display name later for SEO)
6. Complete the sign-up flow (confirm email, skip suggested follows for now)

### 1C. Switch to a Creator Account

This is critical — a Creator account gives you analytics, access to the full music library, and monetization features.

1. Go to your profile (tap your icon, bottom right)
2. Tap the **three horizontal lines** (top right) to open the menu
3. Tap **"Settings and Privacy"**
4. Scroll down to **"Account type and tools"**
5. Tap **"Switch to professional account"**
6. Select **"Creator"** (NOT Business — see why below)
7. Choose your category: **"Digital Creator"** or **"Artist"**
8. Tap **"Done"**

> **Why Creator and NOT Business?**
> - Creator accounts get **full access to Instagram's commercial music library** for Reels. Business accounts are restricted to royalty-free music only. This is a dealbreaker for reach.
> - Creator accounts get access to the **Creator Marketplace** (brand partnerships).
> - Creator accounts can offer **paid subscriptions** and earn **Badges** during Lives.
> - Creator accounts get a **filtered DM inbox** (Primary, General, Requests) which is easier to manage.
> - You can always switch to Business later if needed. It's free and doesn't affect followers.

### 1D. Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Do this immediately to protect your account.

1. Settings and Privacy > **"Accounts Center"** > **"Password and Security"**
2. Tap **"Two-factor authentication"**
3. Choose **"Authentication app"** (more secure than SMS)
4. Follow the setup prompts

---

## 2. Set Up Your Profile

Your profile is your storefront. New visitors spend 1-2 seconds deciding whether to follow you. Every element matters.

### 2A. Profile Picture

Use a recognizable, high-contrast image that reads well at thumbnail size (small circle).

**Recommended options for bl0btoshii:**
- Your main character's face/portrait (e.g., one of the character portraits from the pipeline)
- A simple pixel art logo
- A recognizable character in a clean, square frame

**Tips:**
- Bright colors and simple shapes stand out in the feed
- Avoid detailed scenes — they look muddy at small sizes
- Use a consistent profile picture across all platforms (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram)

### 2B. Display Name (SEO-Optimized)

Your **Name** field (different from your @username) is **searchable by Instagram's algorithm**. Use it for keywords.

**Set your name to:**
```
bl0btoshii | Pixel Art Animation
```

This way you appear in searches for "pixel art," "animation," and "bl0btoshii."

### 2C. Bio

You have 150 characters. Make every word count.

**Recommended bio:**
```
Original animated shorts in NES-style pixel art
New episodes weekly
TikTok + YouTube: @bl0btoshii
```

**What this does:**
- Line 1: Clearly states what you create (searchable keywords: animated, NES, pixel art)
- Line 2: Sets a posting cadence expectation (gives people a reason to follow)
- Line 3: Cross-promotes your other platforms

**Tips for writing your bio:**
- Type it in your Notes app first (for line breaks), then paste it into Instagram
- Do NOT put hashtags in your bio — they are not clickable for discovery
- Keep it scannable — no paragraphs

### 2D. Bio Link

Instagram allows up to **5 links** in your bio.

**Add these links:**
1. Your TikTok profile
2. Your YouTube channel
3. (Later) A link to your latest episode or a Linktree

To add links:
1. Go to your profile > **"Edit Profile"**
2. Tap **"Links"**
3. Tap **"+ Add external link"**
4. Enter the URL and a display title

### 2E. Category Label

Make sure your category is set to **"Digital Creator"** or **"Artist"**. This appears under your name and helps Instagram categorize your account.

You can show or hide this label:
1. Edit Profile > **"Profile display"**
2. Toggle **"Display category label"** on

### 2F. Contact Options

You can add an email for business inquiries:
1. Edit Profile > **"Contact options"**
2. Add your email: system.zero.level@gmail.com

This adds a **"Contact"** button to your profile for brand partnership inquiries.

## 3. Understand the Algorithm

Before you post anything, understand how Instagram decides who sees your content. This determines everything about your strategy.

### The 3 Most Important Signals (confirmed by Instagram head Adam Mosseri, 2025)

1. **Watch Time** — The #1 factor. How long do people watch your Reel? Do they watch it to the end? Do they rewatch it? Instagram measures completion rate obsessively. A 30-second video watched to completion beats a 60-second video abandoned at 10 seconds.

2. **Shares (DMs)** — The strongest signal for reaching NEW audiences. When someone sends your Reel to a friend via DM, Instagram interprets this as "this content is so good it's worth sharing privately." This pushes your Reel to way more people.

3. **Likes** — Still matters, but it's a "lighter" signal compared to shares and saves.

### Secondary Signals That Help

- **Saves** — When someone bookmarks your post for later. This signals lasting value. A post with 50 saves will outperform one with 200 likes.
- **Comments** — Especially long, thoughtful comments and reply threads.
- **Profile visits** — If someone visits your profile after watching your Reel, it signals strong interest.
- **Follows** — If someone follows you directly from your Reel, that's a strong positive signal.
- **Rewatches** — If viewers watch your Reel multiple times, it dramatically boosts reach.

### How Instagram Distributes Your Reels

Your Reel goes through progressively larger audience pools:

1. First shown to a **small subset of your followers**
2. If engagement is strong (watch time + shares), pushed to the **Explore page and Reels tab**
3. If it continues to perform, distributed to **broader non-follower audiences**
4. This process can take **24-72 hours** — some Reels go viral days after posting

### The Critical First 1.7 Seconds

Instagram's data shows users make a **stay-or-scroll decision in approximately 1.7 seconds**. Reels with a 3-second hold rate above 60% outperform those below 40% by 5-10x in total reach.

**This means your opening frame is everything.** (See Section 10 for hook strategies.)

---

## 4. Prepare Your First Batch of Content

**Do NOT post one video and wait.** When new visitors discover you, they'll check your profile. An empty or sparse grid kills follows.

### Before You Start Posting Publicly

1. **Prepare 9-12 pieces of content** before actively promoting your account
2. This gives your grid a "populated" look so new visitors see an active, established brand
3. You can post these over 3-4 days to build up the grid quickly

### What Your First 9-12 Posts Should Include

Since your pipeline generates daily animated episodes, your first batch can be:

- **6-8 animated episode Reels** (your core content)
- **1-2 character introduction Reels** (introduce your main characters one by one)
- **1-2 behind-the-scenes or process Reels** (show how the pixel art is made)
- **1 carousel post** (a character sheet or "meet the cast" image set)

### Export Your Videos Correctly

Your pipeline generates 1080x1920 videos at 9:16 aspect ratio — this is already the correct format for Instagram Reels.

**Technical requirements:**
| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Aspect ratio | 9:16 (vertical) |
| Resolution | 1080 x 1920 px |
| Frame rate | 30 FPS minimum |
| File format | MP4 or MOV |
| Max length | 15 minutes (but keep yours 30-45 seconds) |

## 5. How to Post a Reel (Step by Step)

This is the exact process you'll follow every time you post.

### Step 1: Open Instagram and Start a New Post

1. Open the Instagram app
2. Tap the **"+"** button (bottom center of the screen)
3. Select **"Reel"** at the bottom of the screen

### Step 2: Upload Your Video

1. Tap the **gallery icon** (bottom left) to select a video from your phone
2. Find and select your video file
3. Trim if needed (your pipeline videos should already be the right length)
4. Tap **"Next"** (top right)

### Step 3: Edit (Optional)

On the editing screen you can:
- Add **text overlays** (tap "Aa")
- Add **stickers** (tap the sticker icon)
- Add **music/audio** (tap the music note icon) — only use this if it adds value

For your animated episodes, you likely won't need to add anything — your pipeline already generates the complete video with audio.

Tap **"Next"** when done.

### Step 4: Write Your Caption

This is where Instagram SEO happens. See Section 7 for the full caption strategy.

**Quick template:**
```
[One engaging sentence about this episode]

[2-3 sentences describing what happens or teasing the story]

New episodes every [day]. Follow for more!

#pixelart #animation #indieanimation #retrogaming #nesart
```

### Step 5: Configure Settings

Before posting, set these options:

- **Cover image**: Choose the most visually striking frame, or upload a custom cover image. This is what appears on your profile grid.
- **Tag people**: Skip unless collaborating
- **Add location**: Skip (not relevant for animation content)
- **Add music**: Only if you want to add trending audio on top of your existing audio (usually skip this)
- **Audience**: Set to **"Everyone"** (public)
- **Also share to Feed**: Toggle **ON** (this ensures your Reel appears on your profile grid)

### Step 6: Add Alt Text (Important for SEO)

Instagram's algorithm reads alt text to understand your content for recommendations and search.

1. On the final posting screen, tap **"Advanced settings"**
2. Tap **"Write alt text"**
3. Write a descriptive sentence about your video, e.g.:
   `Pixel art animated short featuring a duck detective investigating a mystery in a retro diner`
4. This takes 10 seconds and helps your discoverability

### Step 7: Post

Tap **"Share"** to publish your Reel.

### Step 8: Stay Active After Posting

**Do NOT post and close the app.** The first 30-60 minutes after posting are critical for the algorithm.

1. Reply to any comments that come in
2. Watch and engage with other content in your niche (like, comment on 5-10 posts)
3. Share your new Reel to your Story (tap the paper airplane icon under your Reel > "Add to your story")
4. Stay active for at least 15-30 minutes

## 6. Cross-Posting from TikTok — The Right Way

You will be posting the same animated episodes to both TikTok and Instagram. There is one critical rule:

### **NEVER post a video with a TikTok watermark on Instagram.**

Instagram's algorithm **detects and actively suppresses** Reels that contain a visible TikTok watermark (the bouncing TikTok logo). Your reach will be crushed.

### The Correct Workflow

Since your pipeline generates the original video files locally:

1. Your pipeline outputs the finished video as an MP4 file
2. **Upload the original MP4 directly to TikTok** (TikTok adds its watermark only when downloading)
3. **Upload the same original MP4 directly to Instagram** (clean, no watermark)
4. Write platform-specific captions for each (see Section 7)

**You should never need to download a video from TikTok to post on Instagram.** Always use your original file from the pipeline output.

### What If You Only Have the TikTok Version?

If for some reason you only have the TikTok version with a watermark:
- Re-export from your pipeline's output folder — the original should always be there
- As a last resort, use a watermark removal tool (SnapTik or similar), but this is not recommended

### Timing When Cross-Posting

Do NOT post to both platforms at the exact same time:
- Post to your **primary platform first** (likely TikTok, since it's automated)
- Post to Instagram **2-4 hours later**, or even the next day
- This avoids duplicate content detection and lets each platform treat your post as fresh

## 7. Hashtag and Caption Strategy

### The Hashtag Shift (Critical — 2025-2026)

**Hashtags are no longer the primary discovery tool on Instagram.** Instagram head Adam Mosseri confirmed that hashtags bring minimal traffic. The platform has shifted to **keyword-based discovery (Instagram SEO)**.

Recent studies show posts without hashtags achieved **23% higher reach** than hashtag-heavy posts.

### Current Best Practice: 3-5 Targeted Hashtags

Use only **3-5 highly relevant hashtags**. Do NOT use 30.

**Recommended hashtag set for bl0btoshii:**

Pick 3-5 from this list per post (rotate them):

| Category | Hashtags |
|----------|----------|
| Core niche | `#pixelart` `#pixelartanimation` `#8bitart` `#16bitart` |
| Animation | `#indieanimation` `#animation` `#animatedshort` |
| Retro/gaming | `#retrogaming` `#nesart` `#retrogames` `#8bit` |
| Content type | `#animationseries` `#shortfilm` `#animatedcontent` |
| Community | `#pixelartist` `#indieartist` `#digitalart` |

### Caption Strategy (This Is Where SEO Happens)

Instagram now indexes caption text for search. Write captions with **keywords** people would search for.

**Caption template:**

```
[Hook — one engaging line that makes people want to read more]

[2-3 sentences describing the episode, using natural keywords like "pixel art," "animated," "retro," etc.]

[Call to action — "Follow for new episodes every week" or "Save this for later"]

#pixelart #indieanimation #retrogaming #animatedshort
```

**Example caption:**

```
When the detective finds a clue but it just raises more questions...

Quacks is back on the case in this week's episode. Original NES-style pixel art animation with custom sound design and music. Every frame hand-crafted.

New episodes dropping every week. Follow to never miss one.

#pixelart #indieanimation #8bitart #animatedshort #retrogaming
```

### What Makes a Good Caption

- **Include keywords naturally** — "pixel art," "animation," "NES-style," "retro" — these are what people search for
- **Tell a micro-story** — Instagram measures "caption dwell time" (how long people spend reading). Longer, engaging captions boost reach.
- **End with a call to action** — "Follow for more," "Save this," "Share with a friend who'd love this"
- **Use line breaks** for readability (type in Notes app, paste into Instagram)

## 8. Posting Schedule

### Recommended Frequency

**3-5 Reels per week.** Consistency beats intensity.

Posting 3 Reels every week is far better than posting 10 one week and 0 the next. The algorithm rewards consistent creators.

Your pipeline generates daily content, but you don't need to post every single day to Instagram. You can:
- Post your best 3-5 episodes per week
- Save the rest for TikTok/YouTube only
- Or batch-post 5 per week if you want daily-ish presence

### Best Days and Times

Based on data from 9.6 million posts:

| Day | Best Times (your local time) |
|-----|-----|
| Monday | 11 AM - 1 PM |
| **Tuesday** | **11 AM - 1 PM, 7 - 9 PM** (peak day) |
| **Wednesday** | **9 PM** (peak day) |
| **Thursday** | **9 PM** (peak day) |
| Friday | 11 AM - 1 PM |
| Saturday | 10 AM - 12 PM |
| Sunday | 10 AM - 12 PM |

**Recommended schedule for bl0btoshii:**

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Tuesday | Post Reel at 12 PM |
| Wednesday | Post Reel at 9 PM |
| Thursday | Post Reel at 9 PM |
| Friday | Post Reel at 12 PM |
| Saturday | (Optional) Post Reel at 10 AM |

> **Note:** Once you have followers, check your own **Instagram Insights** (Profile > Professional dashboard > Insights > Total followers > scroll down to "Most active times") for your specific audience's active hours. This data will override the generic recommendations above.

## 9. Engagement Strategy — Growing from Zero

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2, 0-100 followers)

1. **Complete your profile fully** before promoting anything (bio, profile pic, links, category)
2. **Post your first 9-12 pieces of content** to populate your grid (over 3-4 days)
3. **Tell your existing audience:** Share your new Instagram on your TikTok, YouTube, and any Discord/community you're in
4. **Follow 20-30 accounts in your niche:** pixel art creators, indie animators, retro gaming accounts, lo-fi music channels
5. **Leave genuine, thoughtful comments** on their content (NOT "nice!" or emoji-only). Write 1-2 sentences that show you actually watched/appreciated their work. This gets you noticed.

### Phase 2: Building Momentum (Week 3-8, 100-1,000 followers)

6. **Reply to every single comment** on your posts — no exceptions. This boosts engagement by ~21% and builds community.
7. **Engage before you post:** Spend 15-20 minutes liking and commenting on content in your niche BEFORE posting your own content. This "warms up" the algorithm.
8. **Use Stories daily:** Even on days you don't post a Reel, post a Story. Ideas:
   - Behind-the-scenes of your animation process
   - A poll ("Which character should star in tomorrow's episode?")
   - Share a Reel from another creator you admire
   - A simple "new episode today!" announcement
9. **Share every new Reel to your Story** — this pushes it to followers who might miss it in the feed
10. **Collaborate with other small creators:** Instagram's Collab feature lets you co-post with another account. The post appears on BOTH profiles. Find 2-3 creators at a similar size and propose a collab. There is no follower minimum.

### Phase 3: Acceleration (1,000+ followers)

11. **Optimize for shares:** Ask yourself before every post — "Would someone send this to a friend?" Make content that is relatable, funny, surprising, or satisfying enough to share via DM.
12. **Optimize for saves:** Process videos, character reveals, and satisfying animation loops get saved. Saves are a strong algorithm signal.
13. **Check your Insights weekly** to see what's working (see Section 13).

## 10. Content Strategy for Pixel Art Animation

Your animated episodes are your core content. Here's how to maximize their impact on Instagram specifically.

### Hook Strategies for the First 1.7 Seconds

Since users decide to stay or scroll in ~1.7 seconds, your opening frame must grab attention:

1. **Show the payoff first** — Reveal the funniest or most dramatic moment, then rewind to "how we got here"
2. **Bold text on frame 1** — A text overlay like "This duck has had ENOUGH" immediately creates curiosity
3. **High contrast visuals** — Your NES-style pixel art naturally has bold colors and clean shapes — make sure the first frame showcases this
4. **Pattern interrupt** — Start with something unexpected (a character breaking the fourth wall, an unusual camera angle, a dramatic zoom)
5. **Sound hook** — A distinctive sound effect or music cue in the first second grabs attention from scrollers who have sound on

### Content Types That Perform Well for This Niche

**Tier 1 — Your Core Content (70% of posts):**
- Animated episode Reels (your daily pipeline output)
- Character-focused shorts (episodes highlighting one character)
- Story arc episodes (multi-part stories that keep people coming back)

**Tier 2 — Supporting Content (20% of posts):**
- Character introductions ("Meet Quacks — the world's most paranoid detective")
- Animation loops (walking cycles, idle animations — these are rewatchable and shareable)
- Side-by-side comparisons (first draft vs. final animation)
- "Meet the cast" carousel posts

**Tier 3 — Experimental Content (10% of posts):**
- Behind-the-scenes process videos
- Time-lapses of pixel art being drawn
- Polls and interactive Stories ("What should happen next?")
- Audience-suggested episode ideas

### Making Your Content Shareable

The #1 algorithm signal for reaching new audiences is DM shares. Create content people want to send to friends:

- **Relatable humor** — Characters dealing with universal situations (morning coffee struggles, awkward encounters, workplace chaos)
- **Satisfying visuals** — Smooth pixel art animations, satisfying color fills, pixel-perfect transitions
- **Emotional moments** — Unexpected heartfelt scenes in a comedy series hit hard and get shared
- **"Tag someone who..."** moments — Without explicitly saying "tag someone," create scenarios so relatable that people naturally tag friends

### Reel Cover Images

Your profile grid is a visual portfolio. Design custom cover images for your Reels:

- Use a consistent template (same font, color scheme, layout)
- Show a key character or scene from the episode
- Make it readable at thumbnail size
- This creates a cohesive, professional-looking grid that converts visitors to followers

## 11. What NOT to Do

These actions will actively harm your account. Avoid them completely.

### Content Mistakes

- **Never post with a TikTok watermark.** Instagram detects and suppresses these. Always use your original video file.
- **Never use 30 hashtags.** This is outdated advice. Use 3-5 targeted ones.
- **Never use engagement bait.** "Like if you agree" or "Comment YES for more" — Instagram penalizes this.
- **Never post blurry or low-resolution video.** Technical quality matters to the algorithm.

### Growth Mistakes

- **Never buy followers or engagement.** Fake followers destroy your engagement rate, which is what the algorithm actually measures. A 1% engagement rate on 10K followers (100 of which are real) is far worse than 10% on 500 real followers.
- **Never do mass follow/unfollow.** Instagram detects this pattern and will action-block or shadow-ban your account.
- **Never join engagement pods.** Groups where members artificially like/comment on each other's posts. Instagram detects these patterns.
- **Never post and ghost.** If you post and immediately close the app, you miss the critical first-hour engagement window.

### Profile Mistakes

- **Never leave your bio blank or vague.** "Just vibin'" tells no one what you create.
- **Never use a default or low-effort profile picture.** This is your first impression.
- **Never set your account to Private.** You're a creator — you need to be discoverable.
