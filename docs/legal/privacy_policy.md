# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 16, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how [Your Brand Name] ("we", "us", "our") handles information in connection with the animated short-form video content (the "Content") we publish on third-party social media platforms, including but not limited to TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram (collectively, the "Platforms").

By accessing, viewing, or interacting with our Content on any Platform, you ("you", "your", "user", "viewer") acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.

---

## 1. Overview

- We do **not** use cookies, tracking pixels, or any direct tracking technologies
- We do **not** require you to create an account with us
- We do **not** collect email addresses, names, payment information, or any other personal data from viewers
- All interactions with our Content occur within third-party Platforms that have their own privacy policies

## 3. Third-Party Platform Analytics

### 3.1 What Platform Analytics We Access

The Platforms on which we publish Content provide us with **aggregated, anonymized analytics data** through their built-in creator tools and APIs. This data is collected by the Platforms themselves — not by us — and is made available to us as a content creator. This may include:

- **View counts**: Total number of views on our videos
- **Engagement metrics**: Number of likes, comments, shares, and saves (aggregated)
- **Audience demographics**: Aggregated, anonymized data such as general age ranges, gender distribution, and geographic regions of our audience (provided by the Platforms in aggregate form only)
- **Watch time**: Average and total watch time on our videos (aggregated)
- **Completion rate**: Percentage of viewers who watch our videos to completion (aggregated)
- **Traffic sources**: How viewers found our Content (e.g., search, For You page, direct) (aggregated)

### 3.2 How We Use Platform Analytics

We use the aggregated analytics data described above solely for the following purposes:

- To understand which Content resonates with our audience
- To improve the quality and relevance of future Content
- To make internal content strategy decisions (e.g., which characters or topics to feature)
- To generate internal performance reports

### 3.3 Important Distinction

The analytics data we access is **collected and controlled by the Platforms, not by us**. We access only what the Platforms provide to content creators through their standard creator dashboards and APIs. We cannot identify individual users from this aggregated data.

## 4. Third-Party Platforms

Our Content is published on third-party Platforms, each of which has its own privacy policy governing how they collect, use, and share your personal information. We strongly encourage you to review the privacy policies of the Platforms you use:

- **TikTok**: https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy
- **YouTube (Google)**: https://policies.google.com/privacy
- **Instagram (Meta)**: https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy

We are not responsible for the privacy practices, data collection, or data processing of any third-party Platform. Any personal information you provide to these Platforms (such as your account information, comments, likes, or messages) is subject to their privacy policies, not ours.

---

## 5. Comments and Public Interactions

If you comment on, like, share, or otherwise publicly interact with our Content on any Platform:

- That interaction is governed by the Platform's privacy policy, not ours
- Your comment, username, and profile picture may be publicly visible to other users of that Platform
- We may read and respond to public comments but we do not store or process this information outside of the Platform
- We do not use comments or interaction data for any purpose beyond responding to our audience within the Platform's native tools

## 6. Children's Privacy

### 6.1 General Policy

Our Content is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly target, market to, or collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction).

### 6.2 COPPA Compliance

Since we do not directly collect any personal information from any users, including children, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requirements for direct data collection are not applicable to our operations. However, we are committed to the protection of children's privacy.

### 6.3 Platform Responsibilities

The Platforms on which we publish Content have their own policies and mechanisms for protecting children's privacy, including age-gating and restricted modes. We encourage parents and guardians to review the privacy policies and parental controls of any Platform their children use.

### 6.4 Parental Concerns

If you are a parent or guardian and have concerns about your child's interaction with our Content, please contact us at **system.zero.level@gmail.com**.

---

## 7. Data Security

Since we do not directly collect or store personal information from users, we do not maintain databases of personal information that could be subject to data breaches. The security of any information you provide to third-party Platforms is governed by those Platforms' security practices.

For our internal operations (such as API credentials and analytics data), we employ reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures, including:

- Secure storage of API credentials using environment variables (not hardcoded)
- Access controls limiting who can access internal systems
- Regular review of security practices

---

## 8. International Users

Our Content may be viewed by users worldwide through the Platforms on which it is published. If you are accessing our Content from outside the United States, please be aware that:

- Our operations are based in the United States
- Any aggregated analytics data we access through the Platforms is processed in accordance with the Platform's own data transfer and processing practices
- We do not directly transfer any personal information across borders, as we do not directly collect personal information

### 8.1 European Economic Area (EEA) / GDPR

Since we do not directly collect personal data from users, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements for data controllers regarding direct data collection are not directly applicable to our operations. However, if you believe we hold any personal data of yours and wish to exercise your rights under GDPR, please contact us at **system.zero.level@gmail.com**.

### 8.2 California Residents / CCPA

Since we do not collect, sell, or share personal information as defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the CCPA's requirements for direct data collection are not directly applicable. If you are a California resident and have questions about your privacy rights, please contact us at **system.zero.level@gmail.com**.
